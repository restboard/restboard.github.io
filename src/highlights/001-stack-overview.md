Technically speaking, **Restboard** is a plug & play extension for [Quasar]('https://quasar.dev'), a rich and full-featured frontend framework based on [Vue.js]('https://vuejs.or').

Restboard provides the following building blocks:

  * An [**abstraction layer**](https://github.com/restboard/rb-core-module) over API interaction (based on CRUD model)
  * A [**UI toolkit**](https://github.com/restboard/quasar-app-extension-rb-ui) with ready-to-use visual components for common use-cases
  * A [**CLI (Command Line Interface)**](https://github.com/restboard/quasar-app-extension-restboard?tab=readme-ov-file#cli) to quickly scaffold new resources and views
