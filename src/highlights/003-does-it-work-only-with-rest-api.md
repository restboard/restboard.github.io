No, not really. While Restboard is primarly designed to interact with REST APIs, it doesn't force you to any particular paradigm. In other words, if you need to integrate a GraphQL API you just need to use a proper **data provider**.

You can also combine different APIs for different resources, simply using different data providers: _it's really up to you!_
